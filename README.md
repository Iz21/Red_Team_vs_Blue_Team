# Red_Team_vs_Blue_Team_Project
A Red vs Blue Teams project to run through an exercise of exploiting vulnerable machines and capturing log data with Kibana for the purpose of ultimately being able to create alerts for future potential exploitations, all through the use of Virtual Machines in an Azure Cloud environment
